Model View Controller (MVC)
-> Model
    => Interacts with database, (CRUD)
    => Not interacts with UI | Data Processing
    => Communicates with Controller and not View

-> View
    => The User Interface
    => Languages (HTML5/CSS3/JS/XML etc)
    => Contains Codes to show data to user & respond to events

-> Controller
    => Process the data after getting request from View and before updating anything to the database with Model
    => Request from View, Update in Model

-> The Main Folder Structure <-
    |-> /public
    |-> /app
    |-> .htaccess file (to redirect to the /public when access the domain)

    => /public (Main Application)
        |-> index.php
        |-> /JS
        |-> /CSS
        |-> .htaccess (redirect everything through index.php from /public)

    => /app (Entire Application)
        |-> /MVC directories
        |-> /libraries (Heart of the app, all files must start with Uppercase letter)
        |-> /helpers (eg: session helper file)
        |-> /config  (Basic Stuffs like url root, app root)
        |-> require.php file (requiring all necessary files created from /libraries)
        |-> .htaccess file (to secure the application, the user should not access the /app)

        //Explanations
        => /libraries
            |-> Core.php (can format URL)
            |-> Database.php (Only Model access this file)
            |-> Controller.php (Base Controller Class, extended by other controllers)

        => /config
            |-> config.php
